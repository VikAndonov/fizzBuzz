# FizzBuzz solution

### Notes:
Project is set to run in java 16


### Description:

Execute the code in the Solution class!
The FizzBuzz class contains the logic for when to print fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz or just the number.
The OrderedListCreator is just a helper class to create an ordered list from 1 to 100.
Although I left option to create lists in other ranges as well if needed.
